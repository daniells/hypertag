The Hypertag Project: HTML "Unleashed"

Find out more at the homepage: http://hypertag.io

Here we present the same introductory (beta) hypertag minimized runtime as used on our site for examples and patterns. However, we feel it is suitable for production use, as it is the same version that powers HypertagOS (TagOS). Find out more at http://tagos.io 

This minimized file contain an omnibus version of ALL libraries including jquery, jshint, etc. This is only to facilitate learning. New versions to be included on sites that already have jquery will be posted shortly as will the full, unminimized source, as soon as it sheds the last of it's wayward, late night comments in service of the cleanest possible release.

Thanks, and if you have questions, contact us at info@hypertag.io
